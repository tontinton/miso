When I use a percentage-based width on the child div, it collapses to '0' width on Internet Explorer 7, but not on Firefox or Safari. If I use pixel width, it works. If the parent is relatively positioned, the percentage width on the child works. Is there something I'm missing here? Is there an easy fix for this besides the pixel-based width on the child? Is there an area of the CSS specification that covers this? "}
